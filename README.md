# BES2020_workshop_R
__Efficient and reproducible data analysis in R__

Slides from the live workshop of the Festival of Ecology (15 december 2020)

Organisers:

_Tania Maxwell, INRAE, Université de Bordeaux, Université Laval_ 

_Lukas Weilguny, European Bioinformatics Institute_ 

Field work / Lab work results → data table → R → writing. How can we make this workflow more efficient and reproducible? We’ll go over the basics of RMarkdown, how to think about your data in R using the tidyverse, and some structures of functional programming.

This workshop is intended for anyone with previous experience with the R programming language and is curious and motivated to improve their data analysis and documentation workflow.
